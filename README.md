# AI_ML-TASK_1
# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This is a basic data preprocessing task I completed as part of my AI & ML internship.  
The goal was to prepare raw data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and outlier detection.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset  
- [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 🔍 What I Did
- Checked for null values and handled them using mean/median
- Converted categorical data into numerical using encoding
- Standardized the numerical features
- Visualized outliers using boxplots and removed them
- Created visualizations to understand the data better

##  Learnings
- Importance of data cleaning in ML
- How encoding and scaling improve model performance
- Basics of outlier detection and removal

I'm still learning and building projects like this to grow my skills.  
Thanks for checking it out! 😊
